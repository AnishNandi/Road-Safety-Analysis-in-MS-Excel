# Road-Safety-Analysis-in-MS-Excel
In this project,I worked on a data-driven journey to fetch valuable insights from a vast dataset related to road accidents and it also holds valuable implications for enhancing road safety measures.

Key Achievements:

Data Cleansing and Processing: I engaged most of my time in cleaning and processing the raw data to make it accurate and compact that would help me for subsequent analysis.

Data Analysis: Using advanced Excel features, I performed in-depth data analysis, with a primary focus on the key performance indicator (KPI) - "Total Casualties." I differentiated the dataset by accident severity, providing a clear understanding on how overall casualties are caused by different severity levels .
Vehicle Type Analysis: I examined casualties in relation to vehicle types throwing light on which vehicles were mostly involved in accidents.

Monthly Trend Analysis,Road Type and Surface Analysis: Performed a monthly trend comparison between two years 2021 and 2022 which identified the difference in casualties between the years which would rather help in decision-making on road safety planning.I also identified the road types and surfaces associated with the maximum casualties, offering insights for infrastructure improvements.

Location and Day/Night Analysis:Performed analysis by identifying the no. of casulaties occuring in Day/Night and geographical location of accidents.

Pivot Tables and Dashboards: I constructed dynamic pivot tables and eye-catching dashboards. They represented critical insights, including the percentage breakdown of casualties by accident severity and identifying the types of vehicles responsible for the highest casualties.Those are the primary KPI's.

This project showcases my proficiency in data analysis and visualization in MS Excel. This project indeed helped me to understand the power of Excel in the field of data analytics and also helped me to boost my confidence in Data Analytics.
